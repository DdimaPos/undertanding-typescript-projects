# UNDERSTANDING TYPESCRIPT PROJECT

I collected here the projects that I've written during the course on Udemy.

To run drag-and-drop and select-and-share-a-place projects use these commands

```
npm i && npm start
```

To run typescript-essentials-demo you can run

```
node calculator.js
```

List of projects is:

1. Introductional one. Calculator in terminal
2. Drag and drop cards with project info between 2 categories (active, finished)
3. search and show addresses with google maps (required an API key for google maps, so I've set up a fallback to openlayers)
